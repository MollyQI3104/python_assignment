    Convert text to English Braille. Text could contain new lines.

    This is a big problem, so think through how you will break it up
    into smaller parts and helper functions.
    Hints:
        - you'll want to call text_to_braille
        - you can alter the text that goes into text_to_braille
        - you can alter the text that comes out of text_to_braille
        - you shouldn't have to manually enter the Braille for 'and', 'ch', etc

    You are expected to write helper functions for this, and provide
    docstrings for them with comprehensive tests.
